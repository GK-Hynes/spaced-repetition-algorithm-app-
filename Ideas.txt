Idea for database:
User model and question model.
User will have basic user items, but also an array(?) to be empty at start. 
Question will just hold the 10 basic questions.
Store users question/answers in the empty array on the User model.
This way we keep questions and users separate but also can keep track of which questions the user has gotten right/wrong for algorithm



Todo: 
    use ref for form clearing instead of getElementById





Current iteration of spacerep algorithm: 
    We are currently implementing in the following way:
        User answers question.
        On submit, we check to see if correct or not.
        If correct, then move that question to the back of the array.
        If incorrect, we dispatch an action to move that question to ~middle of the array.
        This cycles forever.
        This the better implementation, but not the best.

    We want to be able to have the questions array, that is in the redux state, be pushed or added to the usersQuestions property
    on the user model so we can keep track of their specific order of questions in the DB.
