Idea for database:
User model and question model.
User will have basic user items, but also an array(?) to be empty at start. 
Question will just hold the 10 basic questions.
Store users question/answers in the empty array on the User model.
This way we keep questions and users separate but also can keep track of which questions the user has gotten right/wrong for algorithm
